## Snapshot

- **Cuisine:** Taiwanese street food
- **Visit timing:** Saturday lunch
- **Standout dish:** Classic bao with pork belly, peanut powder, and coriander

## Highlights

- Counter service keeps plates flowing with zero downtime.
- Fermented greens and pickles cut through richer dishes.
- Excellent cocktails, especially the toasted rice old fashioned.

## Lowlights

- Queue management still chaotic even with the QR sign-in.
- Noise levels spike as the playlist competes with the crowd.

## Dishes Tried

- **Classic bao** — Still the benchmark: soft bun, melting pork, bright herbs; always reorder.
- **Taiwanese fried chicken** — Crunchy, numbing, and perfect with pickled greens.
- **Short rib rice** — Comforting but veers towards heavy; best shared.

## Atmosphere & Service

- Staff juggle waitlist and counter orders with good humour, if a little stretched.
- Space is tight; expect to rub elbows but turnover keeps things moving.
- Neon glow and steamy windows add to the Taipei-night-market vibe.

## Photos

- Exterior: Early queue outside the Lexington Street facade.
- Interior: Counter line buzzing with bao assembly.
- Signature dish: Close-up of the classic bao ready to eat.

## Map Notes

- Short walk from Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus Underground stations.
- Plenty of buses along Regent Street; cycling best avoided due to heavy traffic.
