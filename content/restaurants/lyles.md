## Snapshot

- **Cuisine:** Contemporary British tasting menu
- **Visit timing:** Dinner, Friday
- **Standout dish:** Grilled pollock with asparagus and whey butter sauce

## Highlights

- Quietly attentive service that guides without fuss.
- Seasonal menu that leans into produce at its peak.
- Wine pairing showcases small European growers with flair.

## Lowlights

- Dessert course felt underpowered after the savoury crescendo.
- Hard chairs become noticeable by the fourth course.

## Dishes Tried

- **Grilled pollock, asparagus, whey butter** — A beautiful balance of char, sweetness, and tang; absolutely reorder.
- **White asparagus, smoked eel, sea purslane** — Silky, saline, and compelling; a highlight of the menu.
- **Yorkshire hogget, morels, wild garlic** — Deeply savoury with punchy greens; generous but verging on heavy.

## Atmosphere & Service

- The open kitchen hums rather than roars, lending a calm energy.
- Staff glide between tables with keen observations and gentle humour.
- Playlist nods to jazz without drowning conversation.

## Photos

- Exterior: The restaurant’s understated entrance at golden hour.
- Interior: Sunlight bouncing off whitewashed walls and shared tables.
- Signature dish: The pollock course plated with edible flowers.

## Map Notes

- Five minutes from Shoreditch High Street Overground and close to bus routes along Shoreditch High Street.
- Handy bike racks opposite the restaurant and plenty of lit side streets for taxis.
